# DevOps Engineering Systems

This repository documents my journey of learning **DevOps engineering from a systems and production perspective**.

I am currently learning DevOps and exploring different tools and practices used in real-world infrastructure and platform engineering.  
This repository is intentionally structured to **evolve over time** as my understanding improves.

This is not a finished project.  
It is a **learning-in-public engineering log**.

## Why this repository exists

Most DevOps learning ends up scattered across:
- random notes
- unstructured repos
- copied tutorials
- forgotten experiments

This repository exists to:
- learn DevOps **systematically**
- document *why* things are done, not just *how*
- track mistakes, tradeoffs, and improvements
- build an engineer’s way of thinking, not just tool familiarity

---

## How this repository is organized

Each DevOps tool or area gets its own top-level directory.

Example structure:
```
devops-engineering-systems/
├── terraform/
├── ansible/
├── docker/
├── kubernetes/
├── ci-cd/
```

Inside each directory:
- fundamentals and core concepts
- small experiments and examples
- design notes and patterns
- mistakes and lessons learned

The structure may change as I learn more — refactoring is expected.

## Current status

🚧 **Work in progress**

I am actively learning:
- infrastructure fundamentals
- automation and configuration management
- containerization and orchestration
- CI/CD pipelines and delivery workflows

Some sections may be incomplete or naive at first.
Improvements and corrections are part of the process.

## Learning philosophy

- Focus on understanding **systems**, not just tools
- Prefer simple, explainable designs
- Document failures and wrong assumptions
- Treat documentation as part of the engineering work

---

## Who this repository is for

- Me (primary): to track and deepen my learning
- Reviewers/interviewers: to understand how I think and learn
- Other learners: who want to see a structured DevOps learning path

## Disclaimer

This repository reflects my learning stage at different points in time.  
Earlier implementations may be improved or replaced as my understanding grows.
